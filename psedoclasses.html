        <p>There is no exact distinction between a mountain and a hill. Mountains are usually steeper and higher. Also, a mountain has an autonomy, so a large hill on a mountain plateau does not become a mountain itself. For the demarcation of two connected geoformations, the topographic prominence (shoulder drop) and dominance (distance between each other) are also used. Here again, there are no uniform absolute values. In the European Alps, for example, a prominence of 30 meters is considered to be the standard for the autonomy of a mountain. In the Himalayas, up to 500 meters is used as a criterion. For the more than 1500 mountains worldwide with a prominence of over 1500 meters (4921 ft), the term "Ultra Prominent Peak" has become established.</p>
